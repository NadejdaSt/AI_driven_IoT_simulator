# Wearable Device Health Monitoring Simulator

This project simulates an IoT wearable device that collects sensor data (heart rate, oxygen level, steps, etc.) and uses a machine learning model to predict health status.

## Features

- Simulates a wearable device with different activity levels
- Real-time data collection using threading
- Data processing and health score calculation
- Machine learning model (Random Forest) for health prediction
- Retraining functionality with accumulated data
